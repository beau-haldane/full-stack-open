# Lesson Notes

**Sunday Jan 16, 2022**

Started the day by setting up this git repo. Learning to use git again.

Finishing the day on part 1c of the course. Got up to 'Stateful Component' and am having trouble making much sense of it!

Will try again tomorrow.

Continued working through part 1c. Beginning to understand useState. Taking notes in a workbook for future reference.

**Tuesday Jan 18, 2022**

Feeling like I have a solid understanding of useState now. Taken some thorough notes. Finished working through part 1D and am ready to attempt exercises 1.6-1.14.
