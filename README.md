# Lesson Notes

**Sunday Jan 16, 2022**

Started the day by setting up this git repo. Learning to use git again.

Finishing the day on part 1c of the course. Got up to 'Stateful Component' and am having trouble making much sense of it!

Will try again tomorrow.

**Monday Jan 17, 2022**

Continued working through part 1c. Beginning to understand useState. Taking notes in a workbook for future reference.

**Tuesday Jan 18, 2022**

Feeling like I have a solid understanding of useState now. Taken some thorough notes. Finished working through part 1D and am ready to attempt exercises 1.6-1.14.

**Wednesday Jan 19, 2022**

Finished all of part 1. The exercises were quite challenging, but extremely satisfying to overcome. Making a small start on part 2 tonight. Watched 3 videos about functional programming and I'm already excited to learn more. Figured out why git isn't logging my commits.

**Saturday Jan 22, 2022**

Finished part 2a, retrieving data from much more complex data structures like hashes within arrays. Seeing the app as a web page as opposed to in the terminal is really cool. Loving it!

**Wednesday Jan 26, 2022**

Working on the exercises at the end of part 2b. I'm up to exercise 2.8 but don't have the time or focus right now to complete it. There's a lot of confusing event handling going on with the forms that are being used. Will need to do some solid revision on this part.

Edit: Came back to the exercises of part 2b and managed to finish them off this evening.

**Tuesday February 1, 2022**

Half way through the exercises in 2c "Getting data from server". Pulling in API data and allowing users to search through it. Very useful!

Came back to the challenges after rehearsal. Managed to complete 2.13 to a working standard, but I'm not happy with how easily the navigation breaks. Feels like I've got too much code - it's not simple enough.

**Tuesday February 8, 2022**

Finished Part 2c. Found it challenging to fetch API data using an API key but managed in the end. Had to implement conditional rendering in 'DisplayCountries.js' so that the app wouldn't break while it was still in the process of fetching the weather data. Also figured out that when using variables in an API call URL, I need to use backticks `` and surround the variable with ${} in order for it to work. Lots of learning in this section!

Beginning Part 2d shortly.

Had a very productive day. Finished all of 2d and 2e, ready to move on to part 3!

**Tuesday March 1**

Finished part 3a, making a simple backend with express. Trying to move into part 3b but I must've misunderstood some of the last part, as my backend is written to work with the phonebook app, not the notes app :(

**Friday March 4**

Making a renewed push to get this course finished by the end of June. I'm currently at part 3b trying to figure out what's going on with the backend of 'notes'.

**Saturday March 12**

I've finally finished part 3b, and moved on to part 3c. It's becom evident that the folder structure I've chosen isn't working extremely well, so I'm trying to restructure them to make more sense. It's super complicated with git though, and I keep fucking up and having to undo mistakes (usually deletions)

I'm in COVID-iso for another 5 days, so hopefully I'll get a good productive push out of this time.

Finishing up today part way through part 3c, I'm currently setting up a MongoDB account, awaiting the cluster to be ready so that I can finish the setup process.

**Sunday March 13**

Continuing on from yesterday, I've now got MongoDB up and running and have been successfully adding new database entries, as well as retrieving them with the .save and .find functions respectively. I am about to implement MongoDB into my Notes application after taking a short break.

Continued after a short break. I've just separated the MongoDB code into a separate module, and added a .env file to store sensitive info, as well as adding config vars to heroku. I'm up to 'Database configuration into its own module' in part 3c.

**Monday March 14**

Managed to grind my way through all of part 3c and part 3c today. Finally up to part 4! I've got an app fully deployed on heroku and mongodb with a decent amount of error handling, and I've linted the code for the app.

Today I had some good success using a pomodoro timer app, https://pomofocus.io/

I think I'll use it again tomorrow!
