# Lesson Notes

**Sunday Jan 16, 2022**

Started the day by setting up this git repo. Learning to use git again.

Finishing the day on part 1c of the course. Got up to 'Stateful Component' and am having trouble making much sense of it!

Will try again tomorrow.

Continued working through part 1c. Beginning to understand useState. Taking notes in a workbook for future reference.

**Tuesday Jan 18, 2022**

Feeling like I have a solid understanding of useState now. Taken some thorough notes. Finished working through part 1D and am ready to attempt exercises 1.6-1.14.

**Wednesday Jan 19, 2022**

Finished all of part 1. The exercises were quite challenging, but extremely satisfying to overcome. Making a small start on part 2 tonight. Watched 3 videos about functional programming and I'm already excited to learn more. Figured out why git isn't logging my commits.

**Saturday Jan 22, 2022**

Finished part 2a, retrieving data from much more complex data structures like hashes within arrays. Seeing the app as a web page as opposed to in the terminal is really cool. Loving it!

Working on the exercises at the end of part 2b. I'm up to exercise 2.8 but don't have the time or focus right now to complete it. There's a lot of confusing event handling going on with the forms that are being used. Will need to do some solid revision on this part.

Edit: Came back to the exercises of part 2b and manage to finish them off this evening.
